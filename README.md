##  Challenges Faced

-The data I received from the dataset was quite messy. I had to clean it up using various pre processing steps. Some irrelevant features were dropped.
- GitHub has a 100 MB file limit, which made it impossible to store large `.pkl` files in the repo. I solved this by hosting the files on [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/), which also made them easier to download in the Streamlit app.
- Streamlit Cloud doesn't allow direct access to local storage like Google Drive, so I had to find a way to make model files available via HTTP.
- Initially ran into errors trying to `pickle.load()` files from URLs â€” solved it using `io.BytesIO` for byte stream handling.

> Each roadblock helped me better understand how to combine web app development with scalable data storage.
